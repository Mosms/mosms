# Who AM I?

I'm Bo Fu(付博) from [**Nanjing University**](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/), now I'm major in **Computer Science**.

I have an open mind for all the things unknown to us human (or techs).

My homepage can be seen from [mosms.github.io](https://mosms.github.io/); My personal mo-(b)logs' website can be seen from [Mologs](https://mosms.github.io/Mologs/),

Please feel free to contact me. (By the ways I gave in my homepage.)

与人交流是进步的秘笈，希望我们可以一同进步。
